If for any reason you gave birth outside of a medical facility, you need to attend PNC within 24 hours of giving birth. Even if you feel fine and your baby seems well it is important to go. Because of the amount of blood lost during delivery you can become anemic or have very low blood. You will be given a dose of Vitamin A, and another one when you go to the PNC visit 2 days after the birth which will help raise your blood levels.  Your baby will be weighed, measured and get their first immunizations which are very important to protect your baby against Polio and TB.  You can also register your baby for a birth certificate at this time. It is best to go to PNC two times during the first week of your baby?s life and again when your baby is 6 weeks old. If you haven?t been yet be sure to go this week. Chord care: When your baby is born, the  umbilical chord is cut freeing you from your baby. Once the chord is cut there is a wound where the chord was cut that looks like a tree stump. Keep this wound dry and clean. Don''t put anything on it like  soap, traditional herbs, shea butter or even surgical spirit. Make sure that baby napkins don''t rub or cover the wound. Don''t force the stump of the chord to fall off as it will fall by itself in 10-12 days. Infections of the stump can cause death. See a doctor straight away if there is bleeding from the chord, or if you see any redness or pus around it.', 1457, 1, '1st PNC', 1, '2014-06-24 00:50:22', '2014-07-06 16:18:35'),

It will start to close by itself at about 6 months.This soft spot is not an ulcer and you should not put hot compresses or any herbal medicines on it. The spot should be flat or raised a bit when you feel it. If the spot has sunk down and it feels like a hole you must go to the clinic as your baby is not well.
